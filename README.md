# MindLog

![Mind-Log Banner](/public/banner.png)

_Mind-Log_ is a personal space for writing down anything that sparks my interest. It is used to capture ideas, interesting facts, reflections, and observations as they come. Entries are simple, quick, and kept for future reference.

## Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrahimBoussada/mind-log.git
cd mind-log
npm install
npm run dev
```
